## WinRM

- WinRM stands for Windows Remote Management.
- The protocol WS-Management was developed to remotely manage systems and is the blueprint for the WinRM service.
- The practical implementation of WS-Management protocol was done by Microsoft in WinRM service.
- The WinRM service is used for remotely managing of Windows servers and devices.
- The SOAP protocol is used to communicate messages in WinRM service which uses XML as its messaging format.


## RDP

- Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) (`RDP`) is a network protocol that allows remote access to Windows systems via `TCP port 3389` by default. RDP provides both users and administrators/support staff with remote access to Windows hosts within an organization.

## SSH 

- SSH stands for Secure Shell.
- A more secure way to connect to a remote machine to execute commands or transfer files.
- Uses `TCP port 22`
- Asymmetric Encryption i.e. uses 2 keys public and private key for encryption and decryption respectively.

## Symmetric Encryption

- Uses a single key for encryption and decryption.
- Less secure.

## Asymmetric Encryption

- Uses 2 keys. Public and private key for encryption and decryption respectively.
- More secure.

## Questions and Solutions


- Find the user for the WinRM service and crack their password. Then, when you log in, you will find the flag in a file there. Submit the flag you found as the answer.
