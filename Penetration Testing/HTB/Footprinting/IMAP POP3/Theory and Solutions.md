## IMAP

- Allows access to emails from mail server and allows online management of emails directly on the server that supports folder structures.
- IMAP is a network protocol for the online management of emails in remote server.
- IMAP is text based and has extended functions, such as browsing emails directly on the server.
- IMAP synchronizes messages across multiple devices by storing them on a server, making it ideal for mobile access.

## POP3

- Doesn't have same functionality as IMAP.

### Footprinting the Service

Enumerating the IMAP/POP3 service using `nmap`.

```bash
$ sudo nmap 10.129.17.61 -sV -p110,143,993,995 -sC
[sudo] password for kali:
