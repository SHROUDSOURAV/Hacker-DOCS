## IMAP Commands

- In IMAP the `<ID>` is basically the serial number of the mail. Like if there are `3` mails in the mailbox then they will be serialized like `1,2,3` and so on... so when we select `3` we are trying to access the mail having serial number of `3`.
- The serial number may vary based on the mail you are trying to read or access.
