## DNS

- DNS stands for Domain Name Server.
- Translates the human readable domain name of a website to the IP address.
- There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:
	- DNS root server
	- Authoritative name server
	- Non-authoritative name server
	- Caching server
	- Forwarding server
	- Resolver


|**Server Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DNS Root Server`|The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe.|
|`Authoritative Nameserver`|Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point. Based on the country, company, etc., authoritative nameservers provide answers to recursive DNS nameservers, assisting in finding the specific web server(s).|
|`Non-authoritative Nameserver`|Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.|
|`Caching DNS Server`|Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.|
|`Forwarding Server`|Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.|
|`Resolver`|Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.|

## Types of DNS Records

| **DNS Record** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`            | Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `AAAA`         | Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `MX`           | Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `NS`           | Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `TXT`          | This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam. |
| `CNAME`        | This record serves as an alias for another domain name. If you want the domain www.hackthebox.eu to point to the same IP as hackthebox.eu, you would create an A record for hackthebox.eu and a CNAME record for www.hackthebox.eu.               |
| `PTR`          | The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.                                                                                                                                     |
| `SOA`          | Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact and contains the Authoritative name server hostname of that zone.                                                                           |

## DNS Configurations

- All DNS servers work with 3 types of configuration files. They are :-
	- Local DNS configuration files
	- Zone files
	- Reverse name resolution files

- The DNS server local configuration file is `named.conf` in Linux Distributions. The configuration files are :-
	- `named.conf.local`
	- `named.conf.options`
	- `named.conf.log`

- Location for example :- `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`


### Dangerous Settings

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`allow-query`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-recursion`|Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.|
|`allow-transfer`|Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server.|
|`zone-statistics`|Collects statistical data of zones.

## Zone file

- A plain text file stored in the DNS server that acts as a blueprint for mapping domains with their corresponding IP addresses.
- Contains various types of DNS records. `A`, `AAAA`, `MX` ...etc...
- Can also contain subdomain and their corresponding IP addresses information.
- The zone file is typically stored inside the name server or Authoritative name server of that particular zone responsible for handling DNS queries of that particular zone.

## Zone Transfers

- The process of copying all the DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another name server.
- This maintains consistency and redundancy across other zones.
- Zone Transfers are not entirely secure so if someone intercepts these zone transfers, it might reveal subdomain records, and other DNS information of the organization/website.


### Zone Transfer Process

- **AXFR** -> Full Zone Transfer type. The secondary server makes a full zone transfer request to the primary server.
- **SOA Record Transfer** -> The primary server upon receiving the request responds with a SOA record containing vital info about the zone, its serial number.
- **DNS records transmission** -> The primary server transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS .etc. Once, all the data is transferred the primary server sends a signal to the secondary server indicating completion of zone transfer.
- **ACK** -> The secondary server sends acknowledgement message to primary server.

## Questions and Solutions

- Interact with the target DNS using its IP address and enumerate the FQDN of it for the "inlanefreight.htb" domain.
	- **ns.inlanefreight.htb**

```bash
$ dig ns inlanefreight.htb @10.129.11.147 +short
```

- Identify if its possible to perform a zone transfer and submit the TXT record as the answer. (Format: HTB{...})
	- **HTB{redacted}**

```bash
 dig axfr inlanefreight.htb @10.129.11.147

```

Now in the HINT it is specified that **"zones often have name of a subdomain"** so from the subdomains i.e.

- `app.inlanefreight.htb`
- `dev.inlanefreight.htb`
- `internal.inlanefreight.htb`
- `mail1.inlanefreight.htb`

I tried to perform **zone transfer** in each on of them but I failed except for the `internal.inlanefreight.htb`

```bash
$ dig axfr internal.inlanefreight.htb @10.129.11.147

- What is the IPv4 address of the hostname DC1?
	- **10.129.34.16**


- What is the FQDN of the host where the last octet ends with "x.x.x.203"?
	- **10.12.3.203**
